1.
Single Responsibility Principle(SRP) : 
A class should have only one reason to change meaning it should have only one responsibility

Example : A user should only handle user-related logic, while database -related operations should be handled by a seperate UserRepository class


Easy to Maintain 
Easy to Understand
2.

Open/ Close  Principle

Software entities(classes,modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification

Example : Adding new functionality to a system using inheritance or composition without modifying the existing code


3.

Liskov Substitution  Principle suggests states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without altering the correctness of the program . 
It ensures that the subclass can stand in for its parent class and function correctly in any context that expects the parent class


In other words:

if Class B is a subtype of Class A , then we should be able to replace object of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program


Subclass should extend the capability of parent class ,not narrow it down

4.

Interface Segmentation

Interface should be such that , client should not implement unnecessary functions they do not need .

Many small specific interface rather than one big fat interface


5.

Dependency Inversion Principle

Class should depend on interfaces rather than on concrete classes
